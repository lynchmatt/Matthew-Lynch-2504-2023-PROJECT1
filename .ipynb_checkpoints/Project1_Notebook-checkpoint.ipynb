However, PolynomialSparse has two fields, a linked list of the terms in the polynomial (called terms), and a dictionary (called dict). The dictionary has keys of the degrees present in the polynomial with non-zero coefficients - each key has a value that indicates where in the linked list the corresponding term can be found. The linked list itself is not sorted, so PolynomialSparse sorts the terms by degree and updates their location in the dictionary using the insert_sorted!() function.

As a result, there are no methods for push!() and pop!() for PolynomialSparse.\n",

If the coefficient was not zero, the original element was deleted, and the sum of that element and the term was inserted.
