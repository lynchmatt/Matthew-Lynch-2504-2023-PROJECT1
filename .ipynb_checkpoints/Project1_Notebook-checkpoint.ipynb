    "- Modifications to the addition, multiplication, etc methods for each type were included in the original files within the folder basic_polynomial_operations.jl, and clearly labelled with comments.\n",
    "- Factorisation methods for the different Polynomial types were kept with the original factor file in the polynomial_factorization folder. \n",
    "- Everything related to the CRT that wasn't a new struct is kept in the file CRT_functionality, in the src folder.\n",

    "### Sparse vs Dense Discussion\n",
    "PolynomialDense is less efficient in terms of storage, especially for polynomials that have a large number of zero terms between non-zero terms (ie x^100 - x). This is because PolynomialDense relies on vector indexing to retain order. PolynomialSparse's usage of a linked list avoids this issue, by having each node 'point' to the next largest node (with the notion of 'largest' by dictated by degree size). This bypasses the need to store excess zeroes between terms. Thus PolynomialSparse could represent the same polynomial as PolynomialDense, but use far fewer elements and use less memory as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two potential advantages PolynomialDense could have over PolynomialSparse - lookup time and the addition method. Since PolynomialDense stores its terms in an array, it's lookup time is constant. However, lookup time in a linked list (as is used in PolynomialSparse) is linear, and therefore is less efficient. This is dealt with through the use of the dictionary field in PolynomialSparse. The dictionary has keys of the degrees present in the linked list, and the keys indicate the node in the linked list where the term is stored. When trying to access a term of a given degree in PolynomialSparse, instead of having to search sequentially through the linked list, it can just refer to the dictionary - as dictionary lookup time is constant, this makes term access in PolynomialSparse just as efficient as in PolynomialDense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is still much simpler in PolynomialDense, as it just uses vector addition and the pre-existing term addition method. PolynomialSparse is more computationally complex - it requires retrieving the relevant term to add and checking if the term addition results in a term with a coefficient = 0. If so, the delete_element function must be called."
