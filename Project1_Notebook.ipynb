    "## Intro\n",
    "This notebook organises the written responses and documentation of changes for Tasks 1-6 of Project 1, as well as the perspective seminar write-up. Each task includes a description of the changes made, the relevant code changed, and functionality tests where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "General organisation:\n",
    "- New types were given a file of their own in the same location as the original in the src folder (Term128, PolynomialSparse, PolynomialSparse128, PolynomialModP, PolynomialModP128). \n",
    "- Modifications to the addition, multiplication, etc methods for each type were included in the original files within the folder basic_polynomial_operations.jl, and clearly labelled with comments.\n",
    "- Factorisation methods for the different Polynomial types were kept with the original factor file in the polynomial_factorization folder. \n",
    "- Everything related to the CRT that wasn't a new struct is kept in the CRT folder.\n",
    "- For Task 6, both the original and repeat-squares methods of finding the powers of polynomials are kept in the polynomial_multiplication file. The CRT version of factoring is kept in the CRT file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests\n",
    "- The 'tests' folder contains the existing tests for the integers, and for the four polynomial types (Dense, Sparse, Sparse128 and ModP). \n",
    "- The factorisation tests for each type were kept in the 'factorization_test.jl' file. \n",
    "- The test of runtime comparison between PolynomialSparse and PolynomialSparse128 is kept in the 'timing_test.jl' in the tests folder.\n",
    "- The tests for CRT multiplication are in the CRT_test file in the tests folder."

The dictionary has keys of the degrees present in the polynomial with non-zero coefficients - each key has a value that indicates where in the linked list the corresponding term can be found. The linked list itself is not sorted, so PolynomialSparse sorts the terms by degree and updates their location in the dictionary using the insert_sorted!() function.

    "### Sparse vs Dense Discussion\n",
    "PolynomialDense is less efficient in terms of storage, especially for polynomials that have a large number of zero terms between non-zero terms (ie x^100 - x). This is because PolynomialDense relies on vector indexing to retain order. PolynomialSparse's usage of a linked list avoids this issue, by having each node 'point' to the next largest node (with the notion of 'largest' by dictated by degree size). This bypasses the need to store excess zeroes between terms. Thus PolynomialSparse could represent the same polynomial as PolynomialDense, but use far fewer elements and use less memory as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two potential advantages PolynomialDense could have over PolynomialSparse - lookup time and the addition method. Since PolynomialDense stores its terms in an array, it's lookup time is constant. However, lookup time in a linked list (as is used in PolynomialSparse) is linear, and therefore is less efficient. This is dealt with through the use of the dictionary field in PolynomialSparse. The dictionary has keys of the degrees present in the linked list, and the keys indicate the node in the linked list where the term is stored. When trying to access a term of a given degree in PolynomialSparse, instead of having to search sequentially through the linked list, it can just refer to the dictionary - as dictionary lookup time is constant, this makes term access in PolynomialSparse just as efficient as in PolynomialDense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is still much simpler in PolynomialDense, as it just uses vector addition and the pre-existing term addition method. PolynomialSparse is more computationally complex - it requires retrieving the relevant term to add and checking if the term addition results in a term with a coefficient = 0. If so, the delete_element function must be called."

After completing her undergraduate in pure maths, she did an honours year focused on partial differential equations, and later completed a PhD in quantum superalgebra.\n",
    "Her first job was at Opcom (later bought and renamed to Carmen, then again to SilverRail) as a software tester. She said she had literally no computer experience other than in LaTeX prior to this job, and had to learn C++ on the fly.  She then moved on to work at mining company Deswik.\n",

    "Dr Mehta now works as lead of software engineering and innovation at You.Smart.Thing, a journey planning company that specialises in travel around big events. She enjoys the unpredictable nature of working at a small company, and thrives off the opportunity to get stuck into smaller, interesting problems that require her kind of ‘lateral thinking.’\n",

    "At You.Smart.Thing, she uses C#, React, MongoDB, Docker and Gravitee. I had never heard of many of these before, and found that they’re used for sourcing community help for certain programming languages like React, or are database programs such as MongoDB. Learning more about the tools available to developers is interesting, as my current knowledge is more restricted to basic tools like GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting point she made was about how it can be difficult for data scientists to know what to look for, as companies and clients often don’t even know what they want to know about the data. I think it will be useful to not only learn how to analyse and report on data, but also be able to pull out the relevant information even when given vague instructions. \n"
